More importantly, after it was done and I had follow-up questions several weeks (and months) down the line, Yev was responsive and helpful. He was able to make the needed adjustments right away. I can't stress enough how important it is to work with a designer who you can maintain a relationship with as your needs evolve. I will continue to recommend Beluga Labs to friends looking for elegant, accessible design work."

From start to finish, the experience working with them to redesign and rebuild our website was outstanding.  Here are a few reasons why you want to work with these guys.<br>1) Quality.  All of the design work was super high quality and they did a great job of interpreting our ideas/requests and then producing a really top notch website with a fair amount of complexity.  We couldn't be more pleased with the final product<a href='https://www.upwork.com/o/companies/~0109ca58a88b43ee2e' target='_blank'>...</a>"

Even with a large amount of extra work, they still came in under budget.  I've recommended them to several other companies who are considering site redesigns."

Don't let my 9.5 for design put you off - I would never normally rate anything above 9. My local agency who has some of the very best on their team noted that much of the work achieved was better than they could have done. Everything was easy. Some of my briefs were not all that clear as I wasn't sure of what to do on some pages of my site but Beluga came back with incredible ideas and always executed them as promised and always on time. Thank you Beluga for a truly amazing job - you made the entire experience hassle free."
